    ]
    that means what so ever user demand to know about the stock with their given time frame you have to opt a bit smaller time frame for the same 
    for ex.:
        if user wants to know the about the month data then u have to give time frame of 30minute 
        and so on..

    else only for the current day's data only for axis bank 
    "https://api.upstox.com/v2/historical-candle/intraday/:instrument_key/:interval"

    for the different interval's url generation for axis bank then use this examples :
    [ if user wants the data of today then time_frame is 1minute,30minute
    url = 'https://api.upstox.com/v2/historical-candle/intraday/NSE_EQ|INF846K011K1/30minute'

    ['https://api.upstox.com/v2/historical-candle/NSE_EQ|INE238A01034/30minute/2024-04-11',
    'https://api.upstox.com/v2/historical-candle/NSE_EQ|INF179KC1DH4/30minute/2024-04-11',
    'https://api.upstox.com/v2/historical-candle/NSE_EQ|INE123W01016/30minute/2024-04-11'
    ]
    but, if the user wanted to know the information of history stocks older than 6 months from current date then u did not have to use the time frame of 1minute and 30minute for it.
