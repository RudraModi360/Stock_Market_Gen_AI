# Stock Sarthi 


This project provides a FastAPI-based locally hosted web-application to analyze and predict stock market trends using historical and real-time data. The API leverages various tools such as the LangChain library, FAISS for similarity search, and the Groq language model for generating responses based on the context.

## Note :

- Before Using the **Server.py** as backend please create your own **Groq api key** for good inferencing of llama-70b model ,which we are using in this.

- Also create the **Cohere api key** for faster embedding generation

    OR

    can be done with **OllamaEmbeddings** as well ,but it's taking too much time for generation of same.
